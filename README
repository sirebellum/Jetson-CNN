Convolution Neural Network used for classifying images (car or not car)

Uses COCO dataset and cocoapi for a custom dataset class (COCO/COCO.py) that returns a fixed number of objects and labels cropped and warped from COCO dataset.

MNIST_Test serves as springboard. Tutorial from Tensorflow website.

Usage:
  Training: python3 train_cnn.py [output name]
  Eval: python3 eval_cnn.py [model name]
  
  *[output name] is arbitrary. Will be the name of the folder written to in models/
  *[model name] refers to the [output name] used in training
